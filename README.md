<center><h1>My first RayCaster with miniLibX</h1></center>

This project demonstrates ray casting using C programming language with the Minilibx library. Ray casting is a technique used in computer graphics for rendering 3D scenes by simulating the path of light rays.

## Overview

This repository contains a ray casting implementation in C using the Minilibx library. It showcases basic demos and examples to illustrate the ray casting concept.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
- **C Compiler**: Install a C compiler such as GCC.
- **Minilibx Library**: Install and configure the Minilibx library. (Provide installation instructions or link to resources for Minilibx setup if needed.)

## Usage

To use this project:
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ray-casting.git`
2. **Build the Project**: `cd ray-casting` and `make` (or any build command you use)
3. **Run the Demos**: Execute the demo programs to see ray casting in action.

Example commands:
```bash
make            # Compile the project
./demo1         # Run demo 1
./demo2         # Run demo 2
# Add specific instructions for running your demos or examples
