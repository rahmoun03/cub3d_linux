<center><h1>My first RayCaster with miniLibX</h1></center>

<p>
  This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. our goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.
