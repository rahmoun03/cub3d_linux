# Ray Casting

This project demonstrates ray casting, a technique widely used in computer graphics for rendering 3D scenes. Ray casting involves simulating the path of light rays to determine what objects or surfaces they intersect with in a scene.

## Overview

The repository contains implementations of ray casting algorithms in various programming languages (if applicable). It includes basic demos and possibly more complex examples to illustrate the concept.

## How it Works

Ray casting typically involves the following steps:
- **Casting Rays**: Rays are cast from the observer's viewpoint (often referred to as the camera) into the scene.
- **Intersection Testing**: Check if these rays intersect with any objects or surfaces in the scene.
- **Calculating Intersection Points**: Determine the point(s) where the ray intersects an object's surface.
- **Rendering**: Use the intersection information to render the scene, often by determining lighting, shadows, and object colors.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use and run the code:
1. **Installation**: If there are specific installation or setup instructions, outline them here.
2. **Running the Demos**: Provide commands or steps to run the included demos or examples.
3. **Example Usage**: Offer a simple code snippet or instructions for users to integrate ray casting into their projects.
